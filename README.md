# 📊 Adaptive Regime-Aware Portfolio Optimization

This project implements a hedge fund strategy that dynamically adjusts portfolio allocations based on market regimes identified through volatility and momentum signals. Using exponentially weighted estimators and dynamic signal thresholds, the strategy optimizes asset weights to generate robust alpha across varying market conditions.

## 🔧 Features
- Regime-aware asset allocation logic
- Exponentially weighted covariance estimation
- Momentum-sensitive signal thresholds
- Rolling Sharpe ratio for adaptive rebalancing
- Robust handling of market microstructure changes

## 📁 File
- `HFS_final.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing full implementation, methodology, and result visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in JupyterLab or Google Colab
2. Ensure dependencies like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib` are installed
3. Run all cells to replicate the strategy and visualize the results

## 📈 Outcome
The strategy demonstrates strong regime sensitivity and achieves enhanced risk-adjusted returns by dynamically responding to shifts in volatility and autocorrelation structure.

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Quantitative strategy design
- Real-time risk-adjusted optimization
- Financial signal processing
- Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
